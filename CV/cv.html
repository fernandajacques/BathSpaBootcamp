        <p>I am a junior Web Developer transitioning into the role from a background in science and education. I have strong IT skills, including extensive experience of web-based and desktop software, and 1+ year experience in software testing.</p>

        <p>I love studying and learning new things! In 2001, I enrolled with the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, in Brazil, to complete my BSc in Biological Sciences. Following that, I worked as a lab assistant for two years before going back to the university to get my MSc and PhD in Animal Biology. This experience has taught me to be very methodical and detail-oriented, always watchful for mistakes or unexpected outcomes. It gave me a lot of experience in documenting procedures to make them repeatable and reliable.</p>

        <p>I also have experience teaching different subjects and at different levels, from techinical to undergraduate courses. I have worked as part of multidisciplinary teams to ensure high quality education for students. During this time, as well as teaching I was a mentor to students on their final monography and I helped to organise events within the university.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I am a very prolific crafter. I love sewing, painting, crocheting and embroidering. Experimenting with new media and new techniques allows me to express my creativity, while also producing something beautiful.</p>

        <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, I decided to persue a new career. With my training in science, methodical work and attention to details was a given, so transitioning to software testing and quality assurance felt natural. However, I find problem-solving more appealing and so now I am getting some training in Software developement, and hoping to make a career out of it.</p>
